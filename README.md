# kovacs-quarto
Dev Quarto Template. Will be migrated to initial repo after testing


# Purpose

This repository will serve to test modular implementations of Quarto templates modelled after [Quarto's examples](https://quarto.org/docs/journals/templates.html). The final goal for this repo is to be used in a new quarto project using the following command:

```sh
quarto use template frank113/kovacs-quarto
```

# Quarto Create matter

Below see the conent generated by running:

```sh
quarto create extension format:pdf | kovacs-pdf \n
```

# Kovacs-pdf Format

## Installing

*TODO*: Replace the `<github-organization>` with your GitHub organization.

```bash
quarto use template <github-organization>/kovacs-pdf
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Using

*TODO*: Describe how to use your format.

## Format Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata, describe them.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [example.qmd](example.qmd).
